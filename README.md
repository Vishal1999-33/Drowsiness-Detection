# About

This can be used by riders who tend to drive for a longer period of time that may lead to accidents. This code can detect your eyes and alert when the user is drowsy. There's a minimum amount of time for which one can keep his/her eyes shut. If that time is exceeded an alert will start.

# Algorithm

Each eye is represented by 6 (x, y)-coordinates, starting at the left-corner of the eye (as if you were looking at the person), and then working clockwise around the eye.
